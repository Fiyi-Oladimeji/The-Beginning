<title>The Oxen and the Wheels</title>

<h1>The Oxen and the Wheels</h1>
<h2>From Aesop's Fables</h2>

<p>
A pair of oxen were drawing a heavily loaded wagon along a 
miry country road. They had to use all their strength to pull 
the wagon, but they did not complain.
</p>

<p>
The wheels of the wagon were of a different sort. Though the 
task they had to do was very light compared with that of the 
Oxen, they creaked and groaned at every turn. The poor oxen, 
pulling up with all their might to draw the wagon through the 
deep mud, had their ears filled with the loud compaining of 
the wheels. And this, you may well know, made their work so 
much the harder to endure.
</p>

<p>
"Silence!" the Oxen cried at last, out of patience. "What have 
you wheels to complain about so loudly? We are drawing all the 
weight, not you, and we are keeping still about it besides."
</p>

They complain most who suffer least.
