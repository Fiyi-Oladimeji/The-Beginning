    <h1>Some of my Favorite Sites</h1>
	  <h2>Wikipedia</h2>
	  <p>
	    One of my favorite websites is called
		<a href= "http://www.wikipedia.org">wikipedia</a>.
		This terrific site allows users to enter encyclopedia
		definitions. Over time, the entries can be as reliable as a 
		commercial encyclopedia, and a lot more complete.

	  <h2>Dummies</h2>
	  <p>
	    You can find a lot about upcoming and current
		Dummies books at <a href="http://www.dummies.com">
